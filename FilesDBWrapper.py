    """ Wrapper for a postgres connection with methods to execute various sql
    queries, inlcuding insert and create, safely.

    The connection is re-used, but the cursors are created and closed per
    method, in keeping with the best practices outlined here:
    http://initd.org/psycopg/docs/faq.html#best-practices

    When a connection exits the with block, if no exception has been raised by
    the block, the transaction is committed.
    In case of exception the transaction is rolled back.

    When a cursor exits the with block it is closed, releasing any resource
    eventually associated with it.
